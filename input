- Hello!
- The eTIMSS 2019 SPSS data can be downloaded from the TIMSS 2019 International Database portal: https://timss2019.org/international-database/
- Go to International Database --> SPSS Data --> "TIMSS 2019 SPSS Data - Grade 4 (781 MB)"
- the zipped Grade 4 eTIMSS package is large (163,995 KB), so it is not possible to load here. 
- I apologize
